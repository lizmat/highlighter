    - Up dependency on "has-word"

0.0.18  2022-10-30T12:21:39+01:00
    - Make highlighter only highlight the first if multiple needles given,
      as trying multiple makes life very difficult with completely free
      strings before and after, and the :summmary-if-larger-than feature.
    - Add support for "equal" type to "highlighter", "matches" and "columns"
      mostly to allow easier interfacing with App::Rak
    - Introduce the "Type" role that allows you to assign a type to a
      string, so it can be passed around without needing to tag the type
      along
